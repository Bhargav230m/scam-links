### Using Pull Requests
You can contribute by creating a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request):
1. Fork this repository
2. Make your changes\
  a. Be sure to update all the necessary files if you're adding links
3. Make sure the list is in alphabetical order ([wordcounter.net/alphabetize](https://wordcounter.net/alphabetize))
4. Create your pull request
5. Explain what you changed and why in the pull request description

### Using Issues
If you'd like to use [issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) instead of pull requests, you are welcomed to do so as well.\
If you want a link added to the lists, simply input the link of the "bad" site, and explain why it should be on the list *(if not obvious)*.\
If you want to report an issue/bug, you can also do so, just be sure to explain the issue in as much detail as possible.
