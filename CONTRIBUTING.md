### Using Pull Requests

1. Fork this repository
1. Make your changes\ 
1. Create your pull request

### Guidelines
These are general guidelines for the list. If you mess something up in a pull request, chances are we can easily fix it; no worries.
- Keep everything in alphabetical order;
- Make sure there are no duplicates;
- Avoid subdomains (e.g. google.com not about.google.com);
- Don't include `http://`, `https://`, or `www.` when adding links to the list;
- Links/terms/slashes should be separated with new lines (`\n`) only;
- Don't add new lines that don't have any content;
- Every line on the trailing slash list must start with one `/`;
- Links/slashes shouldn't contain any spaces

**Tip:** You can use [wordcounter.net/alphabetize](https://wordcounter.net/alphabetize) to alphabetize a list and/or remove duplicates.

### Using Issues
If you'd like to use [issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) instead of pull requests, you are welcomed to do so as well.\
If you want to report scam links/terms/slashes, just list them in the issue.
If you want to report an issue/bug, you can also do so, just be sure to explain the issue in as much detail as possible.
